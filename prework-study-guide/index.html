                    <ul>
                        <li>the title element, for the webpage title</li>

                    <li>The best practice is to keep all CSS rules in an external CSS file to keep concerns separated. This file must be linked to in the HTML head.</li>
                    <li>It is also possible to style individual elements inline, or embed rules into the HTML head.</li>
                    <li>CSS rules consist of the HTML element/s to style, followed by a JSON-styled dictionary of property: value.</li>
                    <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
                    <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
                    <li>Global rules can be defined using the wild card symbol (*).</li>
                    <li>Classes can be defined with syntax .new-class, and elements in the HTML file assigned to said class will be styled with the associated rules.</li>

                    <li>JavaScript scripts are linked to in the page body, typically after the footer.</li>
                    <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript variables are dynamically and weakly typed: variable types don't have to be defined and they allow implicit type conversion.</li>
                    <li>Basic data types include Boolean, Number (includes floating point), String and Object, as well as utility types for Null and Undefined.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript debugging can be done by utilising console logging. The page console can be viewed with the browser devtools (Ctrl-Shift-I on Windows and Chrome).</li>
                    <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
                    <li>Conditional structures (including if-else statements) alter the control flow by executing code if the provided condition returns a truthy value.</li>
                    <li>Use the strict comparison operator ("===") to check that the datatype matches as well as the value.</li>
                    <li>Arrays are sequential collections of related data items. Multitype arrays are permitted.</li>
                    <li>Arrays can be iterated over in iterative structures (including for loops).</li>
                    <li>Functions are blocks of code that are executed by calling them by name, allowing for separation of concerns and for repeated calls.</li>
                    <li>Functions can have parameters passed to them when called.</li>
