# Bootcamp Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project utilises principles and skills from the UWA Coding Bootcamp Prework modules to build, style and script a study guide website. The finished product is a webpage containing notes from the prework modules, which can be used as a study guide for the course material.

## Installation

No installation required, as the product is a single webpage.

## Usage

The webpage contains notes about the four key areas of study in the prework course: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. These notes can be used to revise the material that was presented in the course. In addition, the page's DevTools console (Ctrl-Shift-I for Windows, Cmd-Opt-I for MacOS) is running the page's script, which lists the areas of study and picks a random one for the user to revise.

## Credits
